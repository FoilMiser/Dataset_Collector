EARTH PIPELINE V2 TODO
======================

Near-term follow-ups:
- [ ] Add acquisition handlers for stac_catalog, thredds_opendap, and api_tabular strategies.
- [ ] Flesh out targets_earth.yaml with additional NASA/NOAA/USGS collections and richer routing.
- [ ] Create tiny fixture queues to smoke-test classify → acquire → screen → merge → difficulty locally.
- [ ] Wire schema validation for earth_canonical_record_v1.0.0 in yellow_screen_worker.
- [ ] Add sensitivity scrubbing hooks (geo coarsening, PII trimming) before merge.
- [ ] Build Dockerfile + example volume mounts for /data/earth roots.

Nice-to-haves:
- [ ] Optional near-duplicate detection pass tuned for geo/temporal text.
- [ ] Metrics dashboard from _ledger files (counts, bytes, pitch reasons).
- [ ] Example notebooks demonstrating catalog exploration and shard sampling.
