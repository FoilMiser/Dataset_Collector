[~] Pipeline scaffolding
  - [x] Copy baseline orchestration scripts and update storage roots to /data/kg_nav
  - [x] Add download strategies for s3_sync, aws_requester_pays, torrent, figshare
  - [~] Nav episode builder + KG normalization stubs
  - [ ] Harden yellow transforms for record-level filtering/PII scrub in KG context

[ ] Graph normalization
  - [ ] Implement kg_worker to emit nodes/edges/provenance from OpenAlex/Wikidata/COCI/ROR
  - [ ] Add schema validation against openalex_minimal_graph_v1.0.0, crossref_minimal_graph_v1.0.0
  - [ ] Emit sharded JSONL + manifests with checksums

[ ] PII + compliance
  - [ ] pii_scrub_worker for ORCID/public person registries (drop emails/biographies/URLs)
  - [ ] Update restriction phrase list for KG sources (OpenAIRE, S2ORC, etc.)

[ ] Navigation supervision
  - [ ] nav_episode_builder to stitch OpenAlex/COCI/ROR/Wikidata slices into grounded episodes
  - [ ] Difficulty labels + hop counts + evidence lists with IDs only

[ ] Tooling polish
  - [ ] Catalog statistics tuned for graphs (edge counts, node degrees)
  - [ ] Optional parquet output for normalized graph shards
  - [ ] Health checks for requester-pays downloads and torrent policy gates
