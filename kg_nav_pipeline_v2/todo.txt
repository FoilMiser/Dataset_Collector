TODO — KG Navigation Pipeline v2
================================================================================

Legend:
  [x] = Completed
  [~] = Partially addressed / MVP landed
  [ ] = Not yet implemented

================================================================================
VERSION HISTORY (kg_nav adaptation)
================================================================================

v1 -> v2 skeleton:
  [x] Ported math_pipeline_v2 shell into kg_nav_pipeline_v2
  [x] Added routing defaults for KG navigation (sorter pipeline ownership)
  [x] Implemented adapter-based yellow screening + structural metadata hooks

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------
1) Adapter hardening & tests
   [ ] Unit tests for each yellow_screen adapter (wikidata, OpenAlex, Crossref, COCI, ORCID, MeSH)
   [ ] Sample fixtures that exercise PII scrubbing + deny phrase hits

2) Episode synthesis
   [ ] Implement navigation episode generator to transform combined graph shards into episodes before sorter bucketting
   [ ] Add metrics for episode coverage per task_type/domain/category

3) Download strategy coverage
   [ ] Smoke test `s3_sync`/`aws_requester_pays` paths on small fixtures
   [ ] Add resumable snapshot logic for large dumps (OpenAlex, Crossref) with checksum validation

4) Catalog/reporting
   [ ] Extend catalog_builder to summarize routing + structural metadata coverage
   [ ] Add per-routing shard counts for audit

MEDIUM PRIORITY
---------------
5) Denylist + license policy
   [ ] Populate denylist patterns for restricted scholarly providers
   [ ] Add gating for ORCID/PII-sensitive fields beyond simple key scrubbing

6) CI
   [ ] Lint + minimal unit tests for heuristics and path layout
   [ ] Example run_pipeline.sh workflow on tiny fixtures (dry-run + execute)
