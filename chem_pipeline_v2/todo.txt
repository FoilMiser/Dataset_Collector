TODO — Chemistry Corpus Pipeline v2
===============================================================================

Legend:
  [x] = Completed
  [~] = Partially addressed / MVP landed
  [ ] = Not yet implemented

===============================================================================
CURRENT STATE
===============================================================================

v2 skeleton (based on math v2) landed:
  [x] Stage flow and scripts copied and renamed for chemistry
  [x] Chem-specific routing defaults in pipeline_driver.py
  [x] Acquisition strategies include Figshare and GitHub releases
  [x] YELLOW screening plugins for PubChem computed-only and PMC OA

===============================================================================
NEAR-TERM IMPROVEMENTS
===============================================================================

1) Chemistry plugins and inputs
   [ ] Add MoNA/GNPS record-level filters with license-aware routing
   [ ] Tighten PMC OA handling with per-article license evidence
   [ ] Expand PubChem plugin field schemas and validation coverage

2) Safety and routing
   [ ] Enforce record-level license checks when require_record_license is true
   [ ] Add deny phrase coverage for common chemistry publisher terms
   [ ] Wire chem_routing into merge and sorter fallbacks everywhere

3) Testing + fixtures
   [ ] Tiny end-to-end dry-run fixture (classify->acquire->screen) for CI
   [ ] Sample raw inputs for PubChem/PMC plugin regression tests

4) Observability and docs
   [ ] Lightweight metrics: shard counts/bytes per stage
   [ ] How-to guides for adding new chemistry targets and screening modes
