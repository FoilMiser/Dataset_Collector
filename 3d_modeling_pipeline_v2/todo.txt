TODO — 3D Modeling Pipeline
================================================================================

Legend:
  [x] = Completed
  [~] = Partially addressed / MVP landed
  [ ] = Not yet implemented

================================================================================
VERSION HISTORY (3D adaptation)
================================================================================

v1 -> v2 Completed:
  [x] Restructured pipeline stages to match v2 flow (classify → acquire → screen → merge → catalog)
  [x] Added 3D routing fields for downstream sorting (sorter pipeline ownership)
  [x] Preserved strict license evidence + denylist screening

================================================================================
v2 — WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE / BE UPDATED
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Production readiness)
------------------------------------
1) Mesh processing & validation
   [ ] Harden mesh_worker with watertight checks + repair flags
   [ ] Emit normalized mesh hashes for all assets in yellow_screen_worker
   [ ] Add optional thumbnail + point cloud generation toggles

2) Record-level licensing
   [ ] Enforce record-level license parsing for community datasets (Thingi10K/Objaverse)
   [ ] Add per-record SPDX normalization in screening stage

3) Testing + CI
   [ ] Unit tests for mesh hashing + routing metadata coverage
   [ ] Smoke test classify → acquire → screen → merge → catalog on small fixture (sorting handled in sorter pipeline)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality + coverage)
------------------------------------
4) 3D-specific resolvers
   [ ] Add Figshare/GitHub releases download handlers if needed
   [ ] Enrich s3_public listings with checksums and file counts

5) Data normalization
   [ ] Geometry-aware dedupe (lightfield descriptors / embeddings)
   [ ] Texture/material metadata extraction

LOW PRIORITY (Ergonomics + future-proofing)
-------------------------------------------
6) Packaging + deployment
   [ ] Dockerfile for 3D pipeline + example volume mounts
   [ ] Example orchestration (cron/Argo) for recurring runs

7) Observability
   [ ] Metrics on queue sizes, download throughput, and review turnaround
   [ ] Alerts for missing license evidence or stalled downloads

================================================================================
Notes for next iteration
================================================================================
- Keep synthetic/owned assets clearly marked and licensed (CC0 preferred).
- Preserve attribution bundles for CC-BY assets.
- Keep copyleft outputs segregated from permissive pools.
