================================================================================
VERSION HISTORY (port from chemistry v0.9 -> earth v1.0)
================================================================================

Earth v1.0 brings over the chemistry pipeline core: resumable downloads, license
gating, yellow review queues, denylist enforcement, and catalog composition.

================================================================================
v1.0 — FINISHING TOUCHES FOR EARTH SPECIALIZATION
================================================================================

High priority (production readiness)
------------------------------------
1) License verification + compliance hardening
   [~] Confidence scoring for SPDX resolution + automated pattern checks
   [ ] Evidence snapshot fetchers tuned for NASA/NOAA/USGS/ECMWF/GBIF portals
   [ ] License change detection for Copernicus/ECMWF/ESA terms
   [ ] Document legal review checklist for red/yellow edge cases (geolocation, third-party media)

2) Governance + review UX
   [ ] Lightweight review dashboard for yellow queue (CSV/JSON export already available)
   [ ] Batch approval/rejection + reviewer assignment/notifications
   [ ] Run-level audit views (surface run IDs, signatures, provenance)

3) Testing + CI/CD
   [ ] Unit tests for STAC/card/tabular schema validation (field_schemas.yaml)
   [ ] Integration tests for download workers (STAC/API/table) with sample fixtures
   [ ] End-to-end smoke tests (green/yellow/red queues + catalog build)
   [ ] CI pipeline (lint/type checks/tests) with artifact retention

4) Deployment + packaging
   [ ] Dockerfile + docker-compose for reproducible runs with GDAL/NetCDF deps
   [ ] Kubernetes/Helm job templates with secrets/volume wiring
   [ ] Versioned configuration bundles (schemas + denylist + defaults)
   [ ] Publish pinned requirements/lockfiles

Medium priority (quality + coverage)
------------------------------------
5) Data coverage expansions
   [ ] Add STAC discovery helpers for NASA CMR, Microsoft Planetary Computer, and Open Data Cube
   [ ] Ingest climatology indices (ENSO, AO/NAO, SPI) via tabular worker examples
   [ ] Add biodiversity/GBIF documentation targets with sensitive-location handling

6) Metadata + validation
   [ ] Harden schema validation for dataset cards and indicator tables
   [ ] Enforce spatial/temporal coverage parsing with bbox/time extent checks
   [ ] Normalize provider/platform/instrument vocabularies for deduplication

7) Monitoring + alerting
   [ ] Metrics on download times, error rates, queue throughput
   [ ] Prometheus/StatsD exporters and Grafana dashboard examples
   [ ] Slack/email notifications for failures or stalled queues

8) Documentation + onboarding
   [ ] Architecture doc + diagrams (worker roles, pools, queues)
   [ ] Tutorial for adding new Earth targets and resolvers
   [ ] Troubleshooting guide and FAQ for common failures (STAC auth, HTTPS rate limits)
   [ ] API/programmatic access examples

Low priority (ergonomics + future-proofing)
-------------------------------------------
9) Performance + ergonomics
   [ ] Streaming processing for large NetCDF/GeoTIFF sidecar metadata
   [ ] Optional progress dashboards (CLI + web) for long jobs
   [ ] Configurable caching/prefetch for common resolvers

10) Orchestration polish
    [ ] Airflow/Argo examples for scheduled runs
    [ ] Backup/restore procedures for catalogs and manifests
