Post-v2 adaptation punch list
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Parity + routing)
--------------------------------
1) Acquisition + screening hooks
   [ ] Wire PMC OA acquisition as a first-class acquire_worker strategy.
   [ ] Move PubChem computed-only transform into yellow_screen_worker plugins.
   [ ] Add record-level license validation hooks for GBIF/iNaturalist when enabled.

2) Difficulty + routing coverage
   [ ] Expand difficulties_biology.yaml with more domains/categories.
   [ ] Add regression fixtures ensuring routing fields are present in queues.

3) Testing + CI
   [ ] Unit tests for restriction phrase scans and SPDX normalization.
   [ ] Smoke test classify → acquire → screen_yellow → merge → difficulty on small fixtures.

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality + safety)
----------------------------------
4) Screening enhancements
   [ ] Add PHI/PII scanning stubs for clinical/human-subjects buckets.
   [ ] Implement denylist enrichments for biosecurity-sensitive content.

5) Catalog + observability
   [ ] Extend catalog_builder to surface raw/screened_yellow stats and token estimates.
   [ ] Emit metrics on queue sizes, download throughput, and review turnaround.

LOW PRIORITY (Ergonomics)
------------------------
6) Tooling
   [ ] CLI to assign reviewers + notes per target (plugs into review_queue).
   [ ] Dockerfile + example volume mounts for end-to-end runs.
   [ ] Publish pinned requirements/lockfile.

================================================================================
Notes for next iteration
================================================================================
- Keep synthetic/owned problem sets clearly marked and licensed (CC0 preferred).
- Use routing fields consistently for difficulty + downstream sampling.
- Preserve attribution bundles and evidence snapshots for reproducibility.
