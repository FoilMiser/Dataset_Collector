Landing checklist
================================================================================

v1 -> v2 migration:
  [x] Adopted math v2 stage order (classify → acquire_green → acquire_yellow → screen_yellow → merge → catalog).
  [x] Migrated targets to v2 roots and added routing metadata for sorter ownership.
  [x] Swapped download_worker for acquire_worker with dry-run default + done markers.
  [x] Added merge_worker, yellow_screen_worker, and review prep (yellow_scrubber).
  [x] Copied cyber domain helpers (nvd_worker, stix_worker, advisory_worker, pmc_worker).
  [x] Updated docs/run_pipeline.sh to reference targets_cyber.yaml and /data/cyber layout.

Next up (full cyber coverage):
  [ ] Integrate normalization hooks (Option A) in acquire_worker for NVD/STIX/GHSA feeds.
  [ ] Define routing defaults per target (incident_response, vulnerability_data, threat_modeling, etc.).
  [ ] Expand routing coverage for more domains/categories (sorter pipeline ownership).
  [ ] Add smoke-test fixtures covering classify → merge → catalog with sample JSONL shards (sorting handled in sorter pipeline).
  [ ] Refresh denylist + gates once normalization emits cyber-specific fields.
