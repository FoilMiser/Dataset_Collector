TODO — Physics Corpus Pipeline
================================================================================

Legend:
  [x] = Completed
  [~] = Partially addressed / MVP landed
  [ ] = Not yet implemented

================================================================================
VERSION HISTORY (physics adaptation)
================================================================================

v0.9 -> v1.0 Completed:
  [x] Adapted pipeline_driver + targets to physics inventory (targets_physics.yaml)
  [x] Physics-focused license_map, field_schemas, and denylist skeletons
  [x] Added physics-specific queues/gates (copyleft segregation, record-level filters)
  [x] Preserved LaTeX-aware defaults for text chunking

================================================================================
v1.0 -> v1.1 — WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE / BE UPDATED
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Production readiness)
------------------------------------
1) Physics-focused ingestion workers
   [ ] arxiv_physics_filter_worker.py for physics subsets with record-level routing
   [ ] physics_pdf_worker.py to preserve equations + page ranges
   [ ] Hook workers into yellow stage after review approval

2) Manual review UX
   [~] YELLOW review plan export (yellow_scrubber.py)
   [ ] CLI to assign reviewers + notes per target
   [ ] Optional dashboard for approvals with evidence previews

3) Testing + CI
   [ ] Unit tests for physics restriction scans and SPDX normalization
   [ ] Sample queue fixtures for physics targets
   [ ] Smoke test classify -> download -> catalog on tiny physics fixtures

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Quality + coverage)
------------------------------------
4) License handling and safety gates
   [ ] Implement record-level license checks for OER/StackExchange filters
   [ ] Expand restriction phrase library for NoAI/NoTDM language
   [ ] Enforce copyleft segregation in download outputs + catalogs

5) Data normalization
   [ ] Unicode + LaTeX normalization per worker
   [ ] Split-aware partitioning with split_group_id for exercises
   [ ] Near-duplicate detection tuned for physics text/equations

LOW PRIORITY (Ergonomics + future-proofing)
-------------------------------------------
6) Packaging + deployment
   [ ] Dockerfile for physics pipeline + example volume mounts
   [ ] Example orchestration (cron/Argo) for recurring runs
   [ ] Publish pinned requirements/lockfile

7) Observability
   [ ] Metrics on queue sizes, download throughput, and review turnaround
   [ ] Alerts for missing license evidence or stalled downloads

================================================================================
Notes for next iteration
================================================================================
- Keep synthetic/owned problem sets clearly marked and licensed (CC0 preferred).
- For OER/Pressbooks/LibreTexts, require per-record license metadata before release.
- Preserve LaTeX/math symbols end-to-end; avoid ASCII-fying equations during transforms.
