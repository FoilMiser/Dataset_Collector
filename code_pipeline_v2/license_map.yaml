# v0.3 — companion file for code targets (schema v0.8) and pipeline scripts
#
# This is NOT legal advice. It is a conservative, automation-friendly policy layer
# tuned for **code** corpora, where licensing is often per-file and obligations are
# granular. The rules below help the pipeline assign GREEN/YELLOW/RED buckets:
# - "allow" = generally permissive / OK for training with attribution logging
# - "conditional" = may be usable but needs extra handling (attribution, share-alike,
#                    NOTICE propagation, or isolation)
# - "deny_prefixes" = hard reject (NonCommercial, NoDerivatives, proprietary, custom
#                      restrictive terms)
#
# The pipeline stores evidence snapshots so you can audit every decision.
